                    Recently, I discovered and embarked on my first steps in the field of web development, graduating from the <span>Ironhack Full Stack Bootcamp</span>.
                    I enjoyed the experience so much that I decided to pursue a career change. <br /><br />
                    Drawing from my past experience as an architect, I bring a <span>strong sense of design</span> and a <span>passion for details</span> to my work.
                    I am fascinated by the endless possibilities and the continuous learning that comes with web development, and I am always seeking new challenges. <br /><br />
                    The projects showcased in my portfolio were created in less than 3 months with no prior coding experience. 
                    I am excited to see where this journey takes me next
