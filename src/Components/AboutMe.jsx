                <p>AWith a deep love for art and creativity, I chose to study architecture because I was

                    designs. However, my intrigue with the internet and computers led me to consider a
                    career change. Once I started exploring this world, I was blown away by what I found.
                    So, I decided to dive in headfirst to figure out all the amazing possibilities it offers.
